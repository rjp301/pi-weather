# Weather Reporting

Function run as a CRON job for fetching weather data from the Weather Underground API, summarizing that data using Pandas and distributing it using the Gmail API.

Each function of the script is written in the most appropriate language for the job. Python is used for data manipulation and NodeJS is used for interfacing with APIs and generating HTML from templates.

Great care has been taken to logically seperate functions into unique modules.
